            <h2>14. Meta Advertising Disclosure</h2>
            <p>SIG Solutions uses Meta's advertising platform (Facebook Ads and Instagram Ads) to reach potential customers. Here's how we use Meta's advertising services:</p>

            <h3>14.1 Meta Pixel</h3>
            <p>We use the Meta Pixel (formerly Facebook Pixel), a tracking code that allows us to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Track conversions from Facebook and Instagram ads</li>
                <li>Optimize ads based on collected data</li>
                <li>Build targeted audiences for future ads</li>
                <li>Remarket to people who have already taken some action on our Website</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>14.2 Custom Audiences</h3>
            <p>We may create Custom Audiences using information you've provided to us (such as email addresses or phone numbers) to deliver targeted advertising on Meta platforms. This information is securely shared with Meta in a hashed format.</p>

            <h3>14.3 Lookalike Audiences</h3>
            <p>We may use Lookalike Audiences to reach new people who are similar to our existing customers. This helps us find potential customers who are likely to be interested in our services.</p>

            <h3>14.4 Your Choices Regarding Meta Advertising</h3>
            <p>You can control the ads you see on Meta platforms by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Visiting your Facebook Ad Preferences: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences" style="color: #667eea;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">facebook.com/ads/preferences</a></li>
